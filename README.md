🎤 AI Food Song Generator

Welcome to my take on how to use AI and 2 of my favorite things: food and music.

This project lets you enter any dish you love (or hate) and generates a sarcastic, over-the-top song about it — powered by OpenAI.

🍔 What does it do?

Asks you for a dish (e.g. "Spaghetti", "Bratwurst", or "Frozen Pizza")
Lets you choose a song style:
- Rap
- Love Song
- Breakup Song
- Angry Metal Song
- Sad Country Ballad
- Or just pick one randomly 🎲

Then it creates a ridiculous little food song about it using GPT
🧠 

Why?

Because not every AI project needs to change the world!
Sometimes, you just want to hear a country ballad about currywurst –
or if you're like me: procrastinate doing stupid things like this instead of working on real projects to showcase your professional skills.
